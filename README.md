# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict a student's academic performance using supervised machine learning techniques.  
The model analyzes various factors such as study hours, attendance, sleep duration, and screen time to estimate whether a student is likely to perform well academically.

This project demonstrates practical application of Python programming and machine learning concepts, developed as part of my preparation for undergraduate Computer Science programs.
